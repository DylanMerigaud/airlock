# Runs: the proof of every milestone

One block per run: the command, its output (trimmed to what proves the step), and the ids and
URLs a reader can check. The cockpit reads this file; nothing here is retyped by hand.

## M1: the Grafana loop, end to end

Status: in progress (started 2026-08-28).

Track decision: Grafana Labs (Airlock v2). The kill criterion switches to ClickHouse (Falsework)
only if the Agent Engine run cannot reach mcp-grafana on Cloud Run or cannot write the annotation
after the auth options are exhausted. Not triggered.

### Auth path chosen

mcp-grafana 1.3.0 ships its own inbound bearer (`--server-auth-token`, env
`MCP_GRAFANA_SERVER_TOKEN`; unauthenticated requests get 401). Verified locally on 2026-08-28
against the darwin binary: `initialize` with the bearer answers 200, without it 401. So the Cloud
Run service is `--allow-unauthenticated` at the network level and closed at the MCP level; the
agent sends the bearer from `AIRLOCK_MCP_TOKEN` (Secret Manager on Agent Engine) through ADK's
`McpToolset(header_provider=...)`. No ID token dance, no expiry.
